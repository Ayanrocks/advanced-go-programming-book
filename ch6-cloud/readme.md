# Chapter 6 Distributed System

* When someone else points out the problem, don't worry about whether others can do it, see what others are saying right, and then improve themselves. Whether others can do things that are others, can they be better about whether they can develop better. ——hustlihaifeng*

The Go language is known as the C language of the Internet age. Nowadays, the Internet system is not the era when a previous host has done everything. The background service in the Internet era consists of a large number of distributed systems. The failure of any single background server node will not cause the entire system to stop. At the same time, the rise of cloud vendors represented by Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud marks the arrival of the cloud era. Distributed programming in the cloud era will become a basic skill. The Docker and K8s systems built on the Go language have promoted the early arrival of the cloud era.

For distributed systems that are already well-developed, we will briefly talk about how to use them to improve our work efficiency. For systems that do not have an off-the-shelf solution, we will propose a solution based on our business needs.
