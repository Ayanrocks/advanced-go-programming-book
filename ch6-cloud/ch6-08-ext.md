# 6.8 Additional instructions

Distributed is a big field, and the introduction in this chapter can only be regarded as a glimpse of the domain. Because large systems have large flows and high concurrency, many simple solutions can often become difficult to meet. In order to solve various problems in large-scale system scenarios, people have developed a variety of distributed systems. Some systems are very simple, such as the distributed id generator described in this chapter, and some systems can be very complex, such as the distributed search engine in this chapter (of course, the es mentioned in this chapter is not a Go implementation).

Whether it is a simple or complex system, it will reflect their important value in a specific scene. I hope readers can get more exposure to open source, accumulate their own toolbox, and stand on the shoulders of giants.
