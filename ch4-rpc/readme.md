# Chapter 4 RPC and Protobuf

* Learning programming, what is important? Practice more, see more, practice more! After learning cross-language, mastering the basic grammar and language characteristics, the actual combat, the fastest! ——khlipeng*

RPC is the abbreviation of Remote Procedure Call. In layman's terms, it is a function called remote. How far is it in the distance? It may be a different function in the same file, or it may be a function of another process on the same machine, or it may be a secret method far above Mars Curiosity. Because the functions involved in RPC can be very far away, as far as they speak completely different languages, language becomes a barrier to communication on both sides. Protobuf supports a variety of different languages ​​(even unsupported languages ​​can also be extended support), its own features are also very convenient to describe the interface of the service (that is, the method list), so it is very suitable as an interface communication language of the RPC world. This chapter will discuss the basic usage of RPC, how to design your own RPC services for different scenarios, and the larger RPC ecosystem built around Protobuf.
