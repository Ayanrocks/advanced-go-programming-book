## 4.9 Additional instructions

There are currently fewer books dedicated to RPC. At present, the official website of Protobuf and gRPC provides detailed reference materials and examples. This chapter focuses on the RPC of the Go standard library and the gRPC framework based on the Protobuf derivative. It also shows how to customize an RPC framework yourself. The reason why we focus on these limited topics is that these technologies are officially maintained by the Go language team, and the Go language is also the most tacit. However, RPC is still a huge theme, enough to be a separate book. At present, the open source world also has a lot of distinctive RPC frameworks, as well as an RPC system for deep customization of distributed systems. Users can choose the right tools according to their actual needs.
