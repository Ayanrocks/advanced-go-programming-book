Modern software engineering is inseparable from the Web. Broadly speaking, the Web may not even need to be based on the http protocol. As long as it is a CS or BS architecture, it can be considered a Web system.

Even in a seemingly closed game system, because of the increasing online needs of players, it also involves remote communication, which also involves a lot of Web technologies.

So in this era, Web programming is a field of knowledge that programmers must touch. Whether your goal is to become an architect, go to business or be a technical consultant. Knowledge of the web will become your hard currency.
