This chapter begins with a brief introduction to the history of the Go language and a detailed analysis of the evolution of the "Hello World" program in each ancestor language. Then, for the infrastructure represented by arrays, strings, and slices, the process-oriented and duck-object programming represented by functions, methods, and interfaces, and the Go language-specific concurrent programming model and error handling philosophy are briefly introduced. . Finally, for several mainstream development platforms for macOS, Windows, and Linux, several friendly Go language editors and integrated development environments have been recommended, because good tools can greatly improve our efficiency.
