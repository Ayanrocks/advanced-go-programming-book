## 1.8 Additional instructions

This book is positioned in Go language advanced books, so readers need to have a certain Go language foundation. If you don't know much about the Go language, the author recommends learning the Go language with the following information. The first is to install the Go locale, then open the "A Tour of Go" tutorial with the `go tool tour` command. While studying the "A Tour of Go" tutorial, you can read the "The Go Programming Language" (http://www.gopl.io/) tutorial published by the official Go language team. [The Go Programming Language] (http://www.gopl.io/) is called the Go language Bible in the domestic Go language community, and it will take you systematically to learn Go language. While learning, you can try to solve some small problems with the Go language. If you want to consult the API, you can open the built-in document query with the godoc command. The Go language itself not only contains all the documentation, but also the implementation code of all standard libraries. This is the first authoritative Go language material. We think that you should be able to use the Go language at this time.
