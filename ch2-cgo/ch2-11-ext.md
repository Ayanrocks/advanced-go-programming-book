## 2.11 Additional instructions

CGO is a hybrid programming technique between C and Go, so you need to know both languages ​​to be proficient in using CGO. The C language recommends two books: the first is the C programming language written by the father of the C language; the second is the C language interface and implementation of the C language modular programming: the technology to create reusable software. The Go language recommends the officially published "The Go Programming Language" and all the documentation and all the code that comes with the Go language.

Why do you have to spend a lot of energy to learn CGO is a problem. Any technology and language has its own advantages and disadvantages. Go is not a silver bullet, it can't solve all the problems. Through CGO, you can inherit the software heritage of C/C++ for nearly half a century. Through CGO, you can use Go to write shared libraries of C interfaces to other systems. Through CGO technology, the code written by Go can be well integrated into existing software. Ecology - and now the software is officially built on top of the C/C++ language. Therefore, CGO is a backup technology. It is a heavyweight replacement technology for Go and deserves to be studied by any serious Go language developer.
